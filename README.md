# BCHacks

Welcome to Choose Your Own Halloween Adventure! A game created by 3 first-years, Jayati, Pragya, and Teresa for BC Hacks Lite in 2020. 

You will see a file called 'mainFile', which contains the code for our game, as well as a file called 'guitime', our attempt at a GUI, inside this repository. We were able to create the design of the GUI, but unfortunately did not have time to integrate it with our main program. Our main program, however, works great as a console-based game!

This is an adventure game where the user decides their own fate and how they want their story to progress. We took inspiration from Halloween! This game was built using Java and the IDE used was Eclipse.
